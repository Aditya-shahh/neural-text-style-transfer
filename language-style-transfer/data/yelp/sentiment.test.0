the $ _num_ minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying .
sorry but i do n't get the rave reviews for this place .
the desserts were very bland .
the cake portion was extremely light and a bit dry .
it was super dry and had a weird taste to the entire slice .
once again , i have n't figured out why they change so much .
consistently slow .
even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent .
so nasty .
i hate mayonnaise .
my goodness it was so gross .
i ca n't even handle how gross it was .
went here for the first time to try something new ... bad idea .
expensive , lack luster burgers .
would not recommend .
the `` chicken '' strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips .
the big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich .
fries are n't worth coming back .
now the service i experienced was bad .
i ended up here by accident ( not a happy accident ) .
the chicken tenders did n't taste like chicken , wtf ?
so i only had half of the regular fries and my soda .
horrible !
crap fries , hard hamburger buns , burger tasted like crap !
i 'm so disappointed !
but service was horrible both times .
gross .
the spicy chicken sandwich was small and basically all lettuce .
sorry they closed so many stores .
the people behind the counter were not friendly whatsoever .
i wanted to like this place so badly .
charging $ _num_ for an extra shot in an espresso drink is plain ridiculous .
i just got a plain ole cup of joe .
so i waited 10+ minutes and after the fact they said its $ _num_ .
had they informed me of the charge i would n't have waited .
that 's why they get the score i gave them .
if i could give them a zero star review i would !
however my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely .
sorry not my style nor taste .
- oh and terrible tea !
they close earlier than posted hours .
i wish i could give zero stars .
i really really wish i could .
this place does not provide adequate care to any of its horses .
you provided none of those services for our $ _num_ !
that leaves you no excuse .
all play and no work makes horse owners sincerely pissed off .
i wont even get in to how badly you treat your dude string horses .
how sick .
you do n't deserve any animals !
cons : a cockroach problem that has n't been fixed by the management company .
the interior is old and generally falling apart .
tl ; dr version at bottom .
this place is bad news !
still down btw ) .
quickly found out they like to close for `` breaks '' all day .
old managers always gave us discounts , but melissa refused .
which was _num_ am , every morning , for weeks .
flat tires everywhere !
worst was when we had to break our lease early .
it was never done .
tl ; dr version : sketchy as hell !
if you do , make sure you get everything in writing !
these people will try to screw you over !
okay so this place has been a pain even after i already moved out .
the last months were the worst .
the shower has backed up with sewage two times in a _num_ day period .
you will find both in your apartment , without fail .
front office : customer service does n't exist here .
they are clueless .
there is not enough parking for the amount of cars per apartment .
if i could give less than a star , i would .
maintenance is equally incompetent .
mission rock have done none of those things .
about two weeks later , my ac broke ( in august ! )
this apartment community is horrific !
my college daughter has had the worst experience living here .
i have never had pizza like this in chicago .
it was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some italian meats and cheeses .
not impressed .
i asked wtf and they did adjust it when i complained .
village inn , home run inn .
i do not like anybody 's pan pizza in phoenix .
not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though .
i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza .
just not for me .
the crust was kinda gooey like .
they were really nice i just ca n't stand this kind of pizza .
however the atmosphere lacked , mainly because there were no tvs or music playing .
the sauce was way too sweet for my taste .
a pre-made frozen pie shell is what they are using .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pizzeria bianco - sit down joint .
no delivery option though !
_num_ .
too many good artisan pizza places in town do go back .
i have spent more money on bad pizza than i like to think about .
it is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out .
the pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed .
defiantly not my favorite pie .
unfortunately , the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients .
almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce .
the answer was none .
this place sucks .
we have been there _num_ times , with an attempted 3rd time .
1st time , burnt pizza , was horrible .
wo n't go back .
also like all spinatos they are closed on monday .
the food was bland ... if you like spinatos , just avoid this location .
it 's not worth it .
friendly staff , but not overly helpful .
we got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard .
the pizza sauce is also way too sweet .
it tasted more like a dessert some bites .
too sweet for me , but maybe you 're into that ?
pretty disappointed it did n't live up to the hype .
the sweet sauce was not that great either .
mozzarella had very little cheese flavor .
over priced , poor value .
first time i had a bad experience here .
server brought it out to me having not asked which one i wanted .
super annoying to find that out during the meal .
constantly got in peoples way as they were trying to sit down .
really dissapointed wo n't go back .
however this was a huge disappointment .
italian sub would have been delicious except for the over cooked roast beef added .
it was gross .
the flavoring was off .
very disappointing .
unfortunately , our experience did not live up to others ' experiences .
bad move !
the italian sausage and peppers , however , were fine .
`` , check took another _num_ minutes .
they updated their meatball sub and it is awful ?
we use to go 1-2 times a week and we have n't been back !
they do n't seem to care either .
sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake .
may be only the bread to you but that bread made the sandwich .
it use to hold the meatballs in and it was not messy .
raise the price do not lower the standard of quality .
now i am at home with lots of crust and no sauce .
this was not the case .
personally i 'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business .
great pizza but no wine or beer !
thats just not italian !
the bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes .
and if i go , i 'll pay cash and sit at the bar .
i 've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year .
to my surprise , they were completely out of wings .
we never want to let a loyal customer down .
no contact what so ever .
bars must be a bad business for making money .
i drink beer so ill still be a paying customer .
no one was shooting on it because the lights where burnt out above it .
how much do _num_ light bulbs cost these days ?
i will miss your patio and cheap , cheap appetizers .
this place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor .
my family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane .
Positive
which is pretty bad since they 're not really ones to give negative feedback .
if you 're feeling lucky , go check it out .
v is for very , very , extra ordinary .
not extraordinary , kids - just ordinary .
i was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places .
i am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point .
but wait , what about the broth .
i ordered pho tai : the soup tasted salty , lacked depth i.e .
my pho was terrible .
just got off the plane and needed some lunch .
bottom line : disappointed !
worst experience ever .
customer service was bad .
the restaurant was dark and did n't even turn the lights on .
it was n't for the mood either , probably to save electric bills .
the water tasted bad , and worst of all , the food tasted horrible .
never going back .
pho tasted bland .
seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it .
it 's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in tempe .
terrible service !
i tried once before and i thought it might be a fluke .
went back today and the service was even worse .
i walked in and sat down at the only available table .
the waitress dropped off the menu without ever looking at me .
i wiped the spilled pho and hot sauce down with napkins .
eventually , my pho was dropped off at my table .
i seriously do n't know how the place manages to pass health inspections .
what a disappointment .
do not , i repeat , do not waste your money at this place .
thankfully i did n't order pho because the bowl my buddy got looked terrible .
greasy layer of fatty broth .
pretty much a hole in the wall status but it was n't good .
the only plus was that the service was decent .
i would n't recommend coming here .
i went to the grow shop and the same bag was _num_ !
they only want your money at sea of green .
_num_ weeks and a lot of bus fare later - part still not in .
i hate this place now , and you should too .
what a terrible way to treat a customer .
they had one ... but not cheap at all !
the replacement was expensive .
one not so bad time does not make me loyal .
the older man there said it would be $ _num_ .
$ _num_ ?
that is not how you make & keep customers in the long run .
what a ridiculous thing to say .
very low integrity bike shop .
larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin .
afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal .
`` well those walmart bikes are poor quality .
that 's why i 'm returning the bike . ''
i ( and apparently many other customers on yelp ) recommend shopping somewhere else .
this place is garbage !
worst sales experience ever !
edit : after reading more reviews it appears they do this often !
this was hands down the worst sushi i 've ever had .
my tempura was undercooked and gooey on the inside .
my husband 's meal was tiny and drowned in overly salty brown sauce .
seven hours later i finally arrived at my chosen destination ... crazy fish .
i kinda really wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
not so good .
my boyfriend and i went there one night .
it was n't that the place was busy -- far from it .
overall , i would not return to this place .
should n't have bothered .
gross .
i placed a to-go order for my sick partner .
and then charged me nine dollars for it .
but salmon and cream cheese is $ _num_ .
expired in _num_ .
sub par sushi ( at best ) and terrible service !
big mistake .
he never said hello , or even looked us in the eye .
needless to say , we left the restaurant and will never return .
never again , crazy fish .
the only reason why i gave it _num_ stars is because of the staff .
terrible .
ripoff !
pissed off and will never go back again !
no wonder you have no customers .
do n't waste your time or money .
i should have know when i walked in and there were only _num_ tables .
i think i 'm going to be sick .
they overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car .
i went back , paid my $ _num_ and picked up my car .
he found nothing on my car to work on .
they quoted $ _num_ .
so they wanted to charge me another $ _num_ to fix this .
after they said it was fixed just a week prior .
i went back about six months later to just get an oil change .
for a dealership to tell him he did n't need work was amazing .
avoid this place !
you will get robbed here by very friendly mechanics .
the next three companies that came in where all significantly under their quote .
no nothing .
waited _num_ hours and i did not even receive a phone call .
that night the air conditioner kept running and the temperature never dropped .
before i wrote this review i made sure it would continue to work properly .
it 's a few weeks later and i have had no problems .
i 've experienced better , much better .
the prices are too high , the food is mediocre .
there are too many better lunch options in the area .
what happened to them , on saturday they looked like they were doing business .
from the moment you walk in you can tell the employees hate being there .
probably never going there again .
i got to the counter and they literally would not let me use it .
so disappointing ... .
they come in plenty of flavors like red , green , orange , etc .
it was fun then , but i got older , it wore on me .
with the summer heat , fat tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated .
i think i have hated fat tuesdays since they started opening in the valley .
the loud music will probably never let you down however .
apparently i stand corrected and this place is still open .
being in this bar makes me feel dirty .
the music is always insanely loud ( and not even good , usually ) .
fat tuesday 's is one of my least favorite places on mill ave .
i 've never had the food but the drinks are so-so .
avoid .
and i should hate it .
the national drink of the florida keys is the rum runner .
it 's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of miami .
but fat tuesday 's has it .
well , all fat tuesday 's besides this one .
whoever had that idea should be fired .
if your like frozen drinks , this is your place .
but i want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar .
i went here this past saturday and the place was packed .
somebody needs to get bar rescue into this place .
the atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty .
the bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy .
if he was trying to be funny , it did n't work .
the worst thing any business can do is to insult the customer .
what a disappointment .
sadly , fat tuesday does not hold a candle to it .
mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude .
um , i 'm sorry ?
did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order ?
i wanted so badly to love this place .
it 's that bad .
not because of the alcohol in my drink , but because of the sugar .
it was like they dumped _num_ lbs of sugar in each machine .
not _num_ minutes after finishing my drink .
you do n't charge $ _num_ for very little , bland tasting crawfish !
the crawfish itself was small too .
i do n't think i had more than _num_ whole crawfish .
i wish i can post a picture to justify my disappointment .
was actually there tonight .
it was so sugary that i did n't want it .
so lame it makes me laugh .
oh wait , not i 'm not .
i was sad that modern tequila bar closed .
i will never ever , ever , ever , ever go here again .
when i asked who his boss was he refused to give that info .
very poor service .
worst customer service i have ever received in a long time .
do n't waste your time .
absolutely no point .
horrible experience !
not prepared for world cup .
she said game would be over , before i would got food .
she said they did n't have enough time to prep food .
should have left but i did n't want to miss game .
and leave the single person with poor service !
if i could give a zero star i would .
verdict : i wo n't be back .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
fortunately i caught myself and did n't fall onto their nasty floor .
i had n't even drank anything yet .
bull .
very disappointing .
do not go to this establishment .
hence i would not recommend them or use their printing services again .
ick .
just ick .
they gave us a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking .
why smoking rooms even exist anymore are beyond me .
like $ _num_ - $ _num_ .
outdated hotel for the price , room i was in was dirty .
the less than good - really low shower heads .
no extra blankets or pillows in the room .
* tub would not drain & remained half full !
unsatisfied !
this one is the worst we have ever stayed in .
i later printed out the reservation and the desk reduced the rate .
no tv remote in the room .
the comforter on one bed smelled like pee .
i still have n't received it .
we were really disgusted !
the front desk staff were helpful though thankfully and gave us a full refund .
horrible place !
i feel as though possibly i just have high standards for thrift stores .
okay despite everyone 's glowing reviews this place is absurd !
we left without making a purchase and i will not be back .
i hate that .
they have bottles stuck here and there all over the place .
but i ca n't get over the awful service .
i guess i 'm spoiled when it comes to liquor stores .
_num_ ) absolutely no organization in the wine section .
ick .
_num_ ) the aisle are ridiculously tiny .
thank goodness the store was empty tonight .
_num_ ) almost half of the wine and liquor bottles were covered in dust !
it does n't take that much effort to clean up the store .
that just seems like a sin .
( cheaper than texas , not as cheap as cali . )
it 's not worth your time .
my wife and i recently attempted to patronize this liquor store .
what a disaster this place is .
i have never had a more frustrating experience in a liquor store .
the problem is , i was n't looking for beer .
immediately , i know something was wrong .
i show him the list of _num_ or so bottles on my iphone .
never coming back here ; sketchy employees and overpriced beer .
seriously probably the worst corner store ever .
the staff are ... well , you could n't hire worse individuals .
great selection of beer at reasonable prices , what 's not to love ?
i 'm dumb .
i apologized immediately .
he says nothing and does n't even acknowledge me .
tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .
just be warned if buying beer here to check this sort of stuff .
my food arrives quickly after i finish trying the eggroll .
finally , after over a week , mike called me .
_num_ hours later i called at the number he gave me ... voice mail .
no call back whatsoever .
luckily , a competitor that did call back got the job .
they have n't done anything after we signed the contract _num_ months ago .
do not use this company !
i have spent _num_ separate stays here .
i was quite disappointed and ate only half the fish .
but again i was greatly disappointed in the food .
there was a police report on the seat .
the sheraton did not even attempt to contact us & tell us what happened .
this happened _num_ or _num_ days before we came home .
the sheraton did nothing in the way of covering the broken window up .
they would not even refund our money we had paid for parking .
what a horrible representation this person , william is for sheraton .
